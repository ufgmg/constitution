Constitution for Game Makers Guild
==================================

This is the source of the constitution that we have to submit to Student
Activities and Involvement every year.

### Updating the constitution

I use Pandoc to convert the Markdown file to a pretty PDF:

    $ pandoc gmg-constitution.md -o gmg-constitution-$(date +%Y%m%d).pdf

**Remember to update the last-modified date in `gmg-constitution.md`
before producing a new PDF!**
